# Container Images

Work inspired and in the most part based on the [k8s-at-home](https://k8s-at-home.com/)'s team.

These [container images](https://github.com/k8s-home-lab/container-images) are tailored for Kubernetes.

Images are hosted on Github Container Registry [here](https://github.com/k8s-home-lab?tab=packages).

## Purpose

The goal of this project is to support containers for various applications that are not already available from [onedr0p](https://github.com/onedr0p/containers) or [linuxserver.io](linuxserver.io).

## Configuration

For configuration see [here](https://docs.k8s-at-home.com).

## Support

We have a few outlets for getting support with our projects:

- Visit k8s-at-home [Docs](https://docs.k8s-at-home.com/).
- Bugs or feature requests should be opened in an [issue](https://github.com/k8s-home-lab/container-images/issues/new/choose).
